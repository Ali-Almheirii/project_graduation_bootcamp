"""
SQL helpers for domain agents.

This module defines a simple interface for executing read and write queries
against the SQLite database.  Agents can instantiate a `SQLTool` and use
its `read()` and `write()` methods to interact with their respective
tables.  The implementation delegates to the `database` module.

Usage example:

```python
from erp_app.tools.sql_tool import SQLTool

sales_sql = SQLTool("sales")
rows = sales_sql.read("SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = ?", (customer_id,))
sales_sql.write(
    "INSERT INTO leads (customer_name, contact_email, message) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
    (name, email, message),
)
```
"""

    """A helper for executing SQL queries.

    The `name` argument is informational and can be used for logging or
    registration.  It has no effect on query execution.
