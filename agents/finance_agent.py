Finance agent.

This agent automates financial workflows such as listing invoices and
payments and creating new invoices.  It delegates to SQL helpers for
persistence and uses the LLM to produce humanâ€‘friendly summaries of the
results.  Heuristic keyword matching is used to map user queries to
operations; you can extend or replace this with additional LLM calls for
classification if desired.
