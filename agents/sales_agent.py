"""
Sales & CRM agent.

This agent handles operations related to customers, leads, orders and
support tickets.  It exposes a `handle_query()` method that interprets
user requests, executes SQL commands via the `SQLTool`, performs simple
retrieval over the `documents` table via the `RAGTool` and calls the LLM
to summarise results.  The classification of highâ€‘level intent (Sales vs
Finance etc.) is performed by the RouterAgent; within the Sales domain we
use keyword heuristics to map queries to concrete actions.  You can
replace these heuristics with additional LLM calls if desired.

Classify the query into one of these action types:
1. "new_lead" - creating a new sales lead
2. "new_order" - creating a new order
3. "support_ticket" - handling customer support
4. "retrieve_customers" - getting customer information
5. "retrieve_orders" - getting order information  
6. "retrieve_leads" - getting lead information
7. "retrieve_products" - getting product information
8. "rag_query" - asking about procedures, policies, guidelines, definitions, "how to", "what is", "what are"
9. "other" - anything else

Key indicators for rag_query:
- Questions about procedures, policies, guidelines
- "What are our..." / "What is our..." / "How do we..."
- Questions about qualification, standards, procedures
- Definitional questions
